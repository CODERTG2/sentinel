# scout-bot
[WIP] Bot for scouting at FRC competitions.

# Usage
1. You can clone this repo and make changes to better fit your team - suggested
2. You can invite the discord bot Sentinal([a link] (https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1218311467112075375&permissions=8&scope=bot)) to your team's discord server - less flexible

If you face issues either way please raise an issue.
